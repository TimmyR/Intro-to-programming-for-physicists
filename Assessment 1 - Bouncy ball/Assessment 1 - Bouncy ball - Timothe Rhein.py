PHYS20161 Introduction to Programming
Assessment 1: Bouncy Ball

Analyses the bounces of a ball over a minimum height. Requires inputs of
for initial height, minimum height, and the efficiency of the ball's bounce. 
The efficiency is the factor by which the ball loses energy, so that the height
of the next bounce is given by:
    
    next height = current height * efficiency.

Outputs the number of bounces over the minimum height, the time taken for 
the ball to reach the top of the last bounce above minimum height, and a graph 
of the heights and times for every peak above minimum height.
