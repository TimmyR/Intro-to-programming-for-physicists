# Intro-to-programming-for-physicists
Code written for the Introduction to Programming for Physicists course at the University of Manchester - Autumn 2019

This repository holds the code for the first course I did in Python. The course introduced functional programming and covered 
topics from code testing to numerical integration algorithms, data analysis and fitting.
